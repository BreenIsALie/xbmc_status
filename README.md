# xbmc_status

A simple status checking script for running on Linux hosts. Mainly a learning project for me

The script checks the following, and presents it to the user:
* Hostname
* System Version
* System Time
* Memory Usage
* Disk Usage
* IP Addresses

Planned updates are more functions, and hopefully the ability to input the IP of a host, and have it run there
